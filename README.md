# ECU-implementation-using-CAN-protocol

In this project, I successfully implemented a seamless integration of the Body Control Module (BCM) and Light Control Module (LCM) using the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol. The primary objective was to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the vehicle's electronic systems by enabling real-time communication and coordination between these two critical modules. This integration allowed for the exchange of data and commands related to vehicle lighting, contributing to an optimized user experience. Throughout the project, I addressed challenges such as message prioritization and error handling. Rigorous testing and validation procedures were conducted to verify the stability and accuracy of the integrated system. This project paved the way for advanced vehicle control systems, underscoring my ability to deliver innovative solutions at the intersection of automotive electronics.
